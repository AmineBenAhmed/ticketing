# Ticketing System Microservices

This is a distributed ticketing system built with microservices architecture. Each service is built with Node.js and TypeScript and communicates with others via NATS messaging. The system allows users to order merchandise and make payments through Stripe. If an order remains unpaid for more than 15 minutes, a notification is sent to the user.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side logic
- **TypeScript**: Static typing for JavaScript
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing orders, users, and payment details
- **NATS**: Messaging broker for microservices communication
- **Docker**: Containerization for each microservice
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestration to manage containers and deployments
- **Skaffold**: Tool to simplify development workflows with Kubernetes
- **Stripe API**: Integration for handling secure payments

## Architecture Overview

This ticketing system is composed of multiple microservices, each handling a specific business logic domain. Services are fully independent but interact with each other via NATS messaging to maintain data consistency. Hereâ€™s an overview of the main services:

- **Order Service**: Handles merchandise ordering.
- **Payment Service**: Manages payments through Stripe API and verifies transactions.
- **Notification Service**: Notifies users if an order remains unpaid for 15 minutes.
- **Common Library**: Shared library published on npm to avoid code duplication across services.

## Project Features

- **Order Creation**: Users can create orders for merchandise.
- **Stripe Payment**: Secure payment integration with Stripe.
- **Timeout Notifications**: Automatic notifications are sent for orders unpaid after 15 minutes.
- **NATS Messaging**: Real-time data updates between microservices.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Kubernetes and Docker enable easy scaling and deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Docker**: To run containers
- **Kubernetes**: For orchestration (e.g., Minikube)
- **Skaffold**: To manage Kubernetes workflows
